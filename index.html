                <h2>About Me</h2>

                <!--Mechanical Engineering-->
                <p>
                    I'm Aditya Bhatnagar, a Graduate Student from the Department of Mechanical Engineering at the
                    University of Michigan
                    Ann Arbor where I also received my Bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering with a minor in Electrical
                    Engineering.
                    I have quite a wide range of interests ranging from Materials Science and Solid Mechanics to
                    Robotics, Modelling, and
                    Control. My experience consists of the design and analysis of parts and assemblies
                    using multiple CAD and FEA softwares, extensive MATLAB software development for data acquisition and
                    analysis, and
                    the manufacturing and assembly of components and assemblies using hand tools, mills, and lathes.
                </p>

                <!--Coding-->
                <p>
                    A little bit farther away from the area of Mechanical Engineering, I am completely self taught and
                    have a strong
                    interest in programming and "homelabbing". I currently host a few services for close friends and
                    family over Docker
                    which is running on a headless Linux instance. I also have a few other programming related projects
                    in development that I'll update this section with when relevant.
                </p>

                <!--Arts-->
                <p>
                    When I'm not working on Mechanical Engineering projects or playing with programming, I also enjoy
                    photography, reading, watching movies
                    and music. As a photographer, the pictures that often catch my eye are macro photographs of insects
                    & flowers and silhouettes (see above).
                    My genres of choice when it come to reading are almost all fiction and fantasy, though I'm trying to
                    branch out into more nonfiction work. Watching movies is always a pastime that I enjoy and will
                    watch anything from sappy rom-coms
                    to action-oriented movies, to animated masterpieces like the How to Train Your Dragon series.
                    I also enjoy occasionally playing the piano which I learnt up until high school or playing the
                    trumpet, which I learned throughout middle
                    and high school.
                </p>
